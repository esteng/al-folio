I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Center for Language and Speech Processing supervised by [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/), where I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
My work focuses mostly on transforming text into representations of its meaning, often with a general aim of communicating with agents (both digital and human).
Most recently, I have been working on multimodal grounding and human-robot interaction, as well as semantic parsing for Universal Decompositional Semantics.
Before starting my Ph.D., I received my B.A.&Sc. with First Class Honours in Cognitive Science from McGill University, focusing in computer science and linguistics.
While at McGill, I worked as a research assistant at the Montreal Language Modeling Lab (MLML), now MCQLL.
I wrote my honours thesis (supervised by [Timothy O'Donnell](https://todonnell.github.io)) on a variational inference algorithm for a model of language acquisition.
