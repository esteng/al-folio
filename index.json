This has created new challenges but also new opportunities for streamlining and improving educational experiences. The Slack platform is incredibly popular in modern office spaces and offers rapid and efficient communication, we believe that with some minor changes, it could provide and integrated educational environment that enriches student-instructor interactions. In particular, the rapid feedback available through Slack might provide a suitable proxy for face-to-face communication while accommodating individuals facing the myriad additional challenges of teaching and studying from home (e.g. different timezones, unreliable internet, personal responsiblities, etc.).\nIn this project, we focus on the perspective of the instructor, as in a course the instructor typically plays a more active role with the students largely acting as consumers. Our product is designed for a modified course structure, which has been adjusted for remote learning. Students are expected to watch pre-recorded lectures on their own time, and there are mandatory 1-hour office-hour-style discussion periods once a week. Each week has two lectures. The course has 3 assignments and 2 group projects.\n Contextual inquiry Subject The contextual inquiry was conducted with a student with TA-ing experience who has used Slack in the past, but not extensively. We opted to use a contextual inquiry for our user research, as this best puts us in the shoes of someone using Slack for teaching while concomitantly allowing us to build a better persona of the instructor.\n Intents Create an assignment and share it with all students      Send each student their graded assignment with feedback      Assign students to groups for the group project      Assign each group a topic      Create a discussion thread for the weekly office hour and send students a required reading for that week’s office hour         Persona 1: Instructor Based on our CI and background knowledge, we propose the following persona for an instructor: The instructor has multiple responsibilities, of which teaching is only one. Despite the changes associated with remote learning, the instructor endeavours to provide the best possible experience for their students. Thus, efficiency is of paramount importance to the instructor; they are ready to devote time to their course, but want to minimize the amount of time spent on tedious non-teaching activities. Furthermore, the instructor is cognizant of the different cirumstances under which students are learning this semester. The instructor is familiar with Slack's interfaces and is computer-literate.\n Ideation and Analysis  Channels were used for Groups and Assignments A classroom slack environment with relevant areas circled\nWe found that channels (circled in blue) were used for making groups and creating discussion around assignments. To create a channel, the instructor clicks the Add Channel button (green circle). A channel dedicated to sending assignments to students was relatively fast: the instructor simply creates a channel and has it automatically add everyone. Using channels for groups was more tedious. For each group, the instructor needed to click “Add Channel” and type the name of everyone in the group. This means that the instructor would need to create their groups somewhere else (like Excel) and then do a bunch of copy and pasting or typing, even though all of the names are already in Slack.\nWe believe that it should be easier to automatically populate channels with randomly assigned groups in a way that minimizes instructor effort while maximizing flexibility. Furthermore, given the increased number of students who are learning remotely from all over the world, we believe that any changes should natively support grouping students by timezone.\nDirect messages were used to give feedback to students Direct messages were used for giving grades and feedback. For each student the instructor would: click on that student, paste a message like “You got a 95%, my feedback is X”, edit that message, and then send the DM. Doing this for each student is obviously tedious, and it does beg a further question: does the instructor have their grades and feedback in some other document (like Excel) and is pasting them over? Or are they going to each student, grading their assignment, and sending messages as they go? In the Excel case it is a lot of copying and pasting to send a DM to every student, and being able to automatically send templated messages from a spreadsheet would be useful. In the grading-as-they-go case, keeping track of who has been graded would be tedious. In our first CI we did not get far enough into the details of how an instructor grades work to answer this question. Yet we can guess from platforms like Gradescope that instructors like to type out their grade and feedback once without having to later copy and paste into some other platform.\nWe believe that if Slack is to be used for classroom interactions, there should be an easy-to-use interface for managing and updating coursework.\n Finding information involved a lot of browsing for students We also looked at the Slack classroom from the perspective of a student. In finding out what they need to do, we found that our volunteer student traveled broadly around the Slack classroom. They clicked on multiple channels (the bold ones that indicated unread messages) to look for any relevant new information. They clicked on the channel relevant to their assignment and looked for the original information from the instructor. In general we found that the student, who was using Slack for iOS, was swiping back and forth between the channel menu and the messages area often. They also had to scroll far up in the assignment info to find the pinned information from the instructor.\n[Slack Diagram][SlackDiagram1.png] Diagram of how the user performed the various actions during the contextual inquiries\nIn order to minimize the amount of time spent by students traveling between features, we propose adding shortcuts to the interface which allow students to rapidly jump past pinned information.\n  Prototypes and Testing We developed our prototypes using the figma software, building off of Slack templates by figmacrush.\n Initial Prototype Description Introducing users to new features is crucial. Here we have a popup that describes the feature, shows where it is, and provides an obvious button to click. Visibility is guaranteed by slightly graying out the rest of the screen.\n_After clicking the button to create a team, the instructor is presented with this screen. Here the instructor can set their preferences for automatic group creation — no tedious typing required. Crucially the automatic grouping takes into account time zone, which is a factor that instructors have to consider. If the automatic grouping does not take into account a factor important to the instructor then the instructor will have to adjust the groups later. This can be done later without more typing. Here the instructor can see the automatically created groups, and adjust them by dragging names around. Overflow is dealt with by “expand” buttons, though scrolling would also work\nThe nice animation played here is intended to make the user feel good about using the new feature, although we acknowledge that the actual experience of using the feature will be the main determiner of whether they use it again.\nThis is a different feature, also accessible from the main slack sidebar. Here the instructor can find their schedule for things they need to do related to the groups and the assignments. Submission statistics are shown for assignments. Ideally grading would also be possible within the interface somewhere, as having to download files or copy and paste is troublesome. The assignment statistics, which drop down after clicking the little plus, also lead to the ability to schedule reminders for students.\nHere the instructor can schedule a reminder about the assignment to be sent to students at a specific time. We separate date and time so that there’s not a single date picker switching between calendar and clock.\nHere we provide an interface for the student to quickly find information from their instructor. Clicking on the (i) in the top right will immediately scroll the student to the informational post from the instructor, and clicking the calendar icon will scroll the user back to the most recent messages.\nUsability Evaluation For each feature, we conducted formative usability tests with a different subject than was used in the CI. The subject for usability testing is an experienced teacher who currently teaches at the middle and high-school level, and is familiar with teaching in a remote-learning environment. The goals of the first evaluation are to assess the usability of the prototypes with respect to the CI, and to identify any shortcomings to address in further rounds of prototyping. The participant was told that she would be asked to perform a number of tasks on a new software, and that she should do her best and to think out loud. After testing, the subject was debriefed.\nManaging assignments     Creating groups     Scrolling to pinned messages      Second-round Ideation and Prototyping Based on the results of the formative testing, we determined that the product would benefit from additional features. Primarily, in the debrief, the subject expressed a desire for increased flexibility regarding the content of the reminder message sent to students. This feature was added and a final round of summative testing was performed.\nSummative evaluation      UX evaluation To go beyond our evaluations, we conducted a user experience evaluation using a Likert scale questionnaire. This format of post-hoc evaluation allows us to gain deeper insights into the usability of the product and its general impression on the subject after giving them some time to reflect. The questionnaire is available here.\nQuestionnaire results TODO\n Conclusions TODO\n   ","date":1602806400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602806400,"objectID":"ea90dccff21e9e27b84d78916d4be3c3","permalink":"/hci/project1/","publishdate":"2020-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hci/project1/","section":"hci","summary":"Project 1 -- Slack For Instructors","tags":["classwork"],"title":"Slack For Instructors","type":"hci"},{"authors":null,"categories":["classwork"],"content":" HCI Assignment 1: Improving basic functionality of myJHU Graduate students at JHU are faced with a unique challenge of being both students and employees. This means navigating both the standard student-facing sites for registering for classes and checking grades, like SIS and Blackboard, but also employee interfaces such as ESS. Many of these interfaces are available throught the myJHU portal, but learning how to efficiently use the portal takes time. If there's one thing graduate students don't have, it's time to waste figuring out where to find different features in myJHU. While we agree that myJHU provides a valuable service as an aggregator and portal for the variety of services available to graduate students, the interface itself can be clunky and difficult to use. In this assignment, we will endeavour to redesign the interface, optimizing for customizability and speed.\n Contextual inquiry To this end, we performed a contextual inquiry to determine which interfaces were most in need of a redesign, and how actual users interact with myJHU.\nSubject For the purposes of this assignment, rather than recruiting a JHU graduate student, whose experience is colored by having used the interface many times before, we opted to recruit a non-JHU student who would act as a proxy for a brand new JHU graduate student using the interface for the first time.\n Intents Since myJHU is a fairly well-designed page to begin with, we opted to test more intents and narrow down what we would change later on, based on what we saw in our contextual inquiry. These intents were:\nChange profile name Find a book in the library Find Concur system for travel reimbursements Change what you see upon login Check email  Based on our inquiry, we opted to further analyze and re-design the page for intents 1, 3, and 4.\n Contextual inquiry recording     Intent 1: Change profile name Often, new students are assigned a profile with their full legal name, but have a different name that they go by. The following shows the sequential model of our subject attempting to change her name in myJHU:\nResults While the subject was able to find the functions to change the profile easily enough, the save button was all the way at the bottom and took time to find. Another time-waster was two-factor authetication, but for security reasons, this understandably cannot be removed.\n  Intent 2: Find Concur Concur is only one of the services available to grad students through myJHU, which we use as a proxy for finding services in general.\nResults Concur is buried under the \u0026quot;Travel\u0026quot; option in the sidebar, which the subject had to spend some time visually searching for on the screen. Given just the name (not knowing it is used for travel) it would be very difficult to find.\n  Intent 3: Customize Layout The front page of myJHU has news and alerts about various topics at JHU and is spread out over a large area. Students should be able to customize what they see based on what they value.\nResults This turned out to be an impossible task. The subject first went down an incorrect path, assuming that the customization would be part of myProfile. After that, the subject tried to use the \u0026quot;configure\u0026quot; option, which only changes the sidebar. Finally, the subject gave up.\n   Redesign To address the breakdowns in the previous section, we propose a new, more compact site designed in Mockingbird:\nIntent 1: Profile changes We add a quick-link to change the profile directly under the profile picture. This opens a pop-out menu with the options of fields to change in the profile. Opening one of these menus changes the content of the pop-out to a list of editable fields. Contents can be discarded with the close button or saved with the large \u0026quot;confirm\u0026quot; button. These popups allow the user to stay on the same page while updating their information, and update only small parts of their info at a time. The small size of the interface places the \u0026quot;confirm\u0026quot; directly in the subject's view, where before it required a large amount of scrolling to get to.\n Intent 2: Open Concur Rather than forcing the user to use the sidebar, we include a large searchar which can be quickly accessed. As the user types, results begin to be filtered in a quick-search style, until only the top result remains.\nThis interface cuts down on time wasted scrolling over the sidebar and attempting to deduce under which heading different services are located.\n Intent 3: Customize Rather than being spread out and taking up more than the screen, the news and info on the homepage is consolidated into multiple tabs, grouped by topic. This allows for faster access to important information, such as COVID19 updates. The tabs also provide an intuitive interface for customization that everyone is familiar with. Each tab has a close button.\nPressing the close button opens a small prompt which asks the user whether they want to close the window just for the duration of their session, or make their change permanent.\nThis change allows the user to customize the homepage and re-order what they see based on what they care about. It also makes it obvious how to customize the page, which was unclear before.\n Evaluation In the final evaluation, we see that each task took much less time and was more intuitive than before.\n     ","date":1602288000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602288000,"objectID":"d8332b0c080d43adf9cfccbec96cfcf4","permalink":"/hci/assignment1/","publishdate":"2020-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hci/assignment1/","section":"hci","summary":"HCI Assignment 1","tags":["classwork"],"title":"HCI Assignment 1","type":"hci"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594213200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594213200,"objectID":"b56bb7ceb92d2fdb402b4c8c5bd8a45a","permalink":"/talk/2020-acl/","publishdate":"2020-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-acl/","section":"talk","summary":"We introduce a transductive model for parsing into Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) representations, which jointly learns to map natural language utterances into UDS graph structures and annotate the graph with decompositional semantic attribute scores.

After dinner, he offered to do the dishes, but as he was picking up one of the plates his grip slipped and he dropped it. Later, when telling her friend about the night, Lisa said, \u0026quot;Derek broke the plate.\u0026quot;\n Derek was over for dinner at Lisa's house. Lisa claimed that she bought special \u0026quot;unbreakable\u0026quot; plates and challenged Derek to break one. He promptly smacked the plate against the edge of the counter, and broke it. Later, when telling her friend about the night, Lisa said, \u0026quot;Derek broke the plate.\u0026quot;\n    1 2         Both times, the statement \u0026quot;Derek broke the plate\u0026quot; remains unchanged. But based on the different scenarios, we as readers draw very different conclusions. Evidence suggests that even toddlers are able to draw inferences about intentionality and volition (Vaish, Carpenter, and Tomasello 2010).1 Inferences like that in (2), Derek meant to break the plate, while in (1) it was an accident. Furthermore, different scenarios might evoke different levels of volition; we could easily imagine a range of set-ups where Derek is more or less volitional, between the two extremes laid out above. We can also draw a much broader range of inferences from these sentences; for example, we know that Derek is sentient while the plate is not, and that the plate physically changed during the process, but Derek probably wasn't. We know that the plate probably doesn't exist anymore, but Derek does. The list goes on...\nThis raises a few key questions: how is it that identical sentences can evoke a range of different inferences? What kinds of inferences do we draw from language? What other hidden knowledge is lying just under the surface of the language we speak?\nA rich array of work has looked at these questions, including Dowty (1991), who introduced a number of inferences, including \u0026quot;volition\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;awareness\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sentience\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;change of state\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;existed before/during/after\u0026quot;. From there, D. Reisinger et al. (2015), White et al. (2016), Govindarajan, Van Durme, and White (2019), and Vashishtha, Van Durme, and White (2019) annotated a corpus of English sentences these properties (among others) and began modeling them. I myself joined this effort fairly late, contributing to White et al. (2019), which consolidated annotations from across these works into one dataset, the Universal Decompositional Semantics Dataset, or UDSv1.0. My main contribution to this line of work has been working on a parsing model, which learns to automatically extract these inferences from text (Stengel-Eskin et al. 2020).\nBy way of starting, I'll try to summarize the different types of annotations in the dataset. The dataset gives each property a score from -3 to 3, with 3 being \u0026quot;very likely\u0026quot; and -3 being \u0026quot;very unlikely.\u0026quot; The words the annotation applies to are given in bold.\n    Annotation Description Examples    Factuality Factuality inferences represent how likely (or unlikely) a listener thinks a scenario that is to have occurred. Jo left (3), Jo didn’t leave (-3), Jo thought that Cole had left (-1)  Genericity Genericity refers to inferences about the generality of events or event participants Ex. property: genericity-predicate-particular: Amy ate oats for breakfast today (3), Amy ate oats for breakfast every day (-3)  Time Temporal inferences are inferences about how long events might take Ex. property: time-duration-minutes: Tom left (-3), Tom was singing (3)  Word Sense Words can have different senses/supersenses (e.g. bank as a place to keep money (phyiscal location) vs. the bank of a river, (geographical feature)). These sense can apply to differing degrees. Ex. property: \u0026quot;person\u0026quot; supersense Sandy led Rufus by a leash (-3), Sandy led Rufus by a leash (3)  Semantic proto-roles SPR properties (introduced by Dowty (1991)) capture properties typically associated with either agents (the person/thing doing the acting in a sitation) and patients (the person/thing that's being acted upon), like awareness and volition (agent properties) or change of state and being created/destroyed (patient properties) Ex. property: volition Derek broke his arm (-3), Derek broke the wishbone (3)  Ex. property: was used The fragile vase was shipped with bubble-wrap (3), The fragile vase was shipped with haste (-3)    Excavation via other languages When we look at these questions from one linguistic lens alone, we get an impoverished view. Some inferences will present themselves readily, while others will be purely contextual. For example from the English point of view, information on when an event happened is often presented explicitly in the tense of the verb; in another language (such as Mandarin) this information might need to be inferred from context, much like how Derek's level volition in breaking the plate in English needs to be inferred.\nOther languages offer different lenses through which to view these semantic inferences by varying what they make explicit and what is kept below the surface. Think of semantics as a lost city or desert ruin, with different languages acting as different winds, shifting the surface-level sand to uncover different aspects of the same semantic structure.\n Back to Derek and the plate Let's revisit Derek, but this time in a different linguistic setting -- say, Mexico City. Where in English, we'd use the same construction in both scenarios (volitional and non-volitional), in Spanish, we'd probably use a different construction. In scenarios (1) and (2), we'd say something like\n  Spanish Se le rompió el plato a Derek    Direct English gloss Itself to him broke the plate to Derek  Rough English gloss The plate broke itself to Derek  English translation   Derek broke the plate       Spanish Derek rompió el plato    En. gloss Derek broke the plate  En. translation Derek broke the plate     Both can translate to \u0026quot;Derek broke the plate\u0026quot; in English, but the first utterance indicates that it was an accident. A direct gloss of each sentence is immediately below the example. Funnily enough, the direct gloss here looks a lot like what we might find in German!\n  German Der Teller ist dem Derek zerbrochen    En. gloss The-NOM plate-NOM is-AUX the-DAT Derek-DAT broken  Rough En. gloss The plate broke to Derek   En. translation  Derek broke the plate       Derek hat den Teller zerbrochen.    Derek has the-ACC plate-ACC broken  Derek broke the plate 2     So looking at two other languages tells us that while English doesn't necessarily make the distinction between volitional and non-volitional plate breaking (at least in the active voice), other languages do!3\n What about some other inferences Tired of Derek and his plates? Me too. Why not take a step up the linguistic family tree from Spanish and look at its parent, Latin. Latin is a fantastic language for exploring these kinds of inferences for a few reasons. The first is that its a morphologically rich language -- many of the grammatical relations which are encoded by word position in other languages (e.g. subject, predicate, and object in English) are encoded directly on the words. This means that word order is much less important. It also means that wealth of semantic information is encoded in the morphology of a word.\nAnother reason Latin is great for looking at these inferences is the way it's taught. Nouns (and their corresponding adjectives) have cases in Latin, which are different endings to the same stem (much like how verbs in English have different endings for different tenses/moods/persons). The cases are nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, and vocative (and sometimes locative), all with different uses. To help students remember which cases are used when, the cases come with handy names that are taught in textbooks, like \u0026quot;the ablative of agent\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;the dative of reference.\u0026quot; We can match some of these handy mnemonics directly to certain inferences described in Dowty (1991). For example, the \u0026quot;was used\u0026quot; property fits well with the ablative of instrument, where an ablative ending tells us something was used as a tool in an action, i.e.\n  Caesar gladiis occidus est    Caesar-NOM swords-ABL killed-NOM is-AUX  Caesar with swords killed was  Caesare was killed with swords    Similarly, Dowty's \u0026quot;was for the benefit of\u0026quot; property demands nothing less than the dative, in this case often known as the dative of advantage/disadvantage. Cui bono is a famous example of this.4\nThese mnemonic devices not only help students learn Latin, but also help to expose some of the underlying semantic features of the language.\n Genericity Genericity inferences pertain to how particular or abstract a predicate or argument is. For example, it's clear that \u0026quot;dogs\u0026quot; in \u0026quot;My uncle Roger's dogs Fifi and Fido\u0026quot; is different from \u0026quot;dogs\u0026quot; in \u0026quot;my brother is afraid of dogs\u0026quot;, in that the first \u0026quot;dogs\u0026quot; is very particular, while the second one applies to more of a natural kind. Similarly, predicates can be more or less particular or general. Consider:\nMarie ate oatmeal for breakfast every day. Marie ate oatmeal for breakfast yesterday.  The \u0026quot;ate\u0026quot; in (3) is different from the \u0026quot;ate\u0026quot; in (4), which encompases a broader range of instances of an \u0026quot;eating\u0026quot; event. French makes this distinction quite clear on the surface level:\n  Marie a mangé du gruau pour son petit déjeuner hier    Marie has eaten of the oatmeal for her small lunch yesterday  Marie ate oatmeal for breakfast yesteray         Marie mangeait du gruau pour son petit déjeuner tous les jours    Marie ate-PROG of the oatmeal for her small lunch all the days  Marie ate (imperf.) oatmeal for breakfast every day      Here, we have two different tenses for actions in the past which were repeated or more general, and those which are more specific instances. These same tenses (imperfect and perfect) relate also to time duration annotations, which can be found in the UDS dataset (White et al. 2019).\n Awareness/sentience Awareness and sentience are probably my favorite proto-roles; what could better describe the impressive human capacity for language than the entirely unconscious ability to rapidly draw inferences about philosophically layered concepts like awareness and sentience? German (another morphologically rich language) makes certain inferences about awareness and sentience quite clear in its use of case with certain verbs. In English, a speaker surprised by something might say:\nI don't believe it!  While an incredulous person might say:\nI don't believe him!  where the \u0026quot;it\u0026quot; in (5) is clearly non-sentient (i.e. a news story, a state of affairs, a juicy piece of gossip, etc.) while \u0026quot;him\u0026quot; in (6) is sentient. In German, these two objects, while arguments of the same verb, take different cases (accusative and dative, respectively):\n  Ich glaube es nicht!    I believe it-ACC not  I don't believe it      Ich glaube ihm nicht!    I believe him-DAT not  I don't believe him     A German speaker thus explicitly represents beliefs about the sentience/non-sentience of an object while choosing a case for an object.\n Conclusions By no means am I suggesting, with the examples above, that these inferences are impossible to draw in different languages, or even necessarily more difficult. All languages are infinitely expressive, and given enough clarification, any inferences about proto-roles, genericity, time duration, or word sense can be made as plain as in any other language. I instead hope to draw attention to the ways that languages encode some of these inferences explicitly in the grammar, lending support to their status as real linguistic concepts rather than figments of the imagination.\nNor do I want to give the impression that speakers of these different languages differ in their judgements of these inferences, or that having the inferences explicitly represented in the grammar or morphology somehow increases our awareness of them. I don't know of any research to this effect, and have not experienced this myself. In fact, the miracle is that all of this happens largely unconsciously, and that there seems to be wide agreement between speakers on these inferences. That all speakers of a language can even agree on a meaning for what is said is miraculous, but that they can also to a large extent on what is not said is even more astounding.\nFinally, these are just some examples from some languages that I happen to be familiar with. I'd love to find more examples like these, so if you can think of ones in other languages (especially non-WEIRD languages!) please don't hesitate to reach out! Similarly, if you can think of counter-examples in these languages or others, shoot me a message.\n References Dowty, David. 1991. “Thematic Proto-Roles and Argument Selection.” Language 67 (3).

However, studies using multiple speech corpora remain difficult in practice, due to corpus size, complexity, and differing formats. We introduce open-source software for unified corpus analysis: integrating speech corpora and querying across them. Corpora are stored in a custom ‘polyglot persistence’scheme that combines three sub-databases mirroring different data types: a Neo4j graph database to represent temporal annotation graph structure, and SQL and InfluxDB databases to represent meta-and acoustic data. This scheme abstracts away from the idiosyncratic formats of different speech corpora, while mirroring the structure of different data types improves speed and scalability. A Python API and a GUI both allow for: enriching the database with positional, hierarchical, temporal, and signal measures (eg utterance boundaries, f0) that are useful for linguistic analysis; querying the database using a simple query language; and exporting query results to standard formats for further analysis. We describe the software, summarize two case studies using it to examine effects on pitch and duration across languages, and outline planned future development.","tags":null,"title":"Polyglot and Speech Corpus Tools: A System for Representing, Integrating, and Querying Speech Corpora.","type":"publication"}]
