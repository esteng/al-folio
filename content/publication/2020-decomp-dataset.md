abstract = "We present the Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) dataset (v1. 0), which is bundled with the Decomp toolkit (v0. 1). UDS1. 0 unifies five high-quality, decompositional semantics-aligned annotation sets within a single semantic graph specification---with graph structures defined by the predicative patterns produced by the PredPatt tool and real-valued node and edge attributes constructed using sophisticated normalization procedures. The Decomp toolkit provides a suite of Python 3 tools for querying UDS graphs using SPARQL. Both UDS1. 0 and Decomp0. 1 are publicly available at this http URL."
