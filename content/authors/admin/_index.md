I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Center for Language and Speech Processing supervised by Benjamin Van Durme, where I am working on broad questions in computational semantics. My most recent line of work is on semantic parsing for the Universal Decompositional Semantics formalism. I'm also interested in applying ideas from the philosophy of language to NLP and in multimodal semantic parsing from text and images. Before starting my Ph.D., I received my B.A.&Sc. with First Class Honours in Cognitive Science from McGill University, focusing in computer science and linguistics. While at McGill, I worked as a research assistant at the Montreal Language Modeling Lab (MLML), now MCQLL. I wrote my honours thesis (supervised by Timothy O'Donnell) on a variational inference algorithm for a model of language acquisition.
