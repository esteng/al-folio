I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the Center for Language and Speech Processing supervised by Benjamin Van Durme, where I am generously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 
My work focuses mostly on transforming text into representations of its meaning, whether via a semantic parse or through action in embodied agents. 
Most recently, I've worked on semantic parsing for the Universal Decompositional Semantics formalism. 
I'm also interested in applying ideas from cognitive science to NLP. 
Before starting my Ph.D., I received my B.A.&Sc. with First Class Honours in Cognitive Science from McGill University, focusing in computer science and linguistics. 
While at McGill, I worked as a research assistant at the Montreal Language Modeling Lab (MLML), now MCQLL. 
I wrote my honours thesis (supervised by Timothy O'Donnell) on a variational inference algorithm for a model of language acquisition.
